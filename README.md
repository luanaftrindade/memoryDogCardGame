# Doggo's Memory Cards Game

Welcome to the cuttest Memory Card Game that you will see today! This game was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It features beautiful dogs (all dogs are beautiful, right?) from [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com/) and follows the MVC architecture (at least I tried).

## Overview

The Doggo's Memory Cards Game is a classic matching game where players can test their memory by flipping cards to find matching pairs of cute dogs.

## Features

### Game Levels

1. **Level 1:** 2x2 board
2. **Level 2:** 4x4 board

### New Features - I'm working on it 

- **Sounds:** Enjoy a more immersive experience with sound effects.
- **Rules and Text:** Clear rules and text to guide players through the game.
- **Bugs (or may I call it features?):** Fixing one bug related to flipped cards - which only occurs very occasionally; fixing the moves counter issue in level two.

## APIs Used

The game uses [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com/) to showcase adorable dog images on the memory cards.

## MVC Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to organize and structure the code for better maintainability.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. Click 'play' to start playing the game. The 'start' button will count the moves and the time playing. 
4. Match pairs of cards by flipping them over.
